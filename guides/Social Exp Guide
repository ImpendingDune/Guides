Social xp is a purely cosmetic skill that has almost no benefit in-game other than a few items such as island npc's, 
however as a skill it's fun to grind it anyways.

The only way to gain social xp is by visiting or being visited by other players in-game. The first time a unique visitor visits you it gives 10 social xp.
After that you gain 2 xp per minute if you are physically on your island while a guest is there, but that doesn't count when you leave the island. You also
gain 1 xp per minute whenever you're visiting other people's island. This said the fastest way to gain xp is to have people afking on your island while the
other slower method is to afk on other people's island. A good way is to take turns with a friend each night. You will need a booster cookie or an afk pool
wherever you are however or else you will be booted for being inactive. Theoretically you could also warp random people to your island but it's not suggested 
since its annoying to other people.
